This can be tedious and time consuming, especially when you have to deal with a lot of servers - enter Ansible! Ansible allows automating tasks on a wide range of platforms, including Linux, Windows, and Mac. It is based on so called playbooks, roles and tasks. Once defined, it is really easy to deploy the defined settings to target machines. All it needs is adding a few lines to the hosts file and defining host_vars to let Ansible know what kind of tasks to execute.\nStarting out # As I didn\u0026rsquo;t know much about Ansible before, I decided to study already existing playbooks in order to learn more about how it works. The Arch infrastructure repository helped me a lot understanding how to setup the different roles needed. I began by writing a role for all kind of common tasks like installing base packages, setting up services and installing a MOTD.\nHost_vars and conditionals to the rescue # Since not every host needs to be configured the same way, host_vars provide a neat way to define what task to execute on which machine. I also added a few conditionals to the role to make sure that certain tasks are only executed if needed - eg. Chaotic-AUR GPG keys don\u0026rsquo;t need to be fetched every time the playbook is executed. There was also one issue with our docker-compose configurations - as the repo was closed source previously, it contained a lot of sensible environment variables in those files. In order to make it open source, those variables needed to be replaced with Ansible variables. Thanks to the template feature of Ansible, it is quite easy to supply a template docker-compose.yml.j2 (Jinja2 formatting) which then gets rendered into a proper docker-compose.yml file with the variables replaced when the playbook is executed. Also, ansible-vault is a great little tool that allows encrypting sensitive files and data easily - Ansible automatically decrypts the content when deploying changes.\nAutomating everything! # While writing the different roles, I had so much fun that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop working on it until it was all automated. Ansible Galaxy also came in handy, as it provided an already existing playbook for basic hardening of Linux installations and SSH with the devsec.hardening collection. Meanwhile, I also rewrote our existing Nginx configurations to better fit our needs. Thinking about how I used Nginx Proxy Manager to handle web server needs not too long ago, I\u0026rsquo;m somewhat happy I finally learned how to do it properly. It just provides so much more flexibility conerning configurations and setup. While NPM worked fine for the time being, it feels really good to be able write own Nginx configurations!\nChaotic-AUR cluster bootstrap? # Well, since I\u0026rsquo;m also operating Chaotic-AUR, it was natural to also include it in the process of automating stuff. After a long trial and error session, the chaotic_aur role is now available on Chaotic\u0026rsquo;s Github organization. It is also available in Garuda\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure repository as git submodule and can be used to setup a whole cluster if provided with the correct host_vars.\nThrowing in some GitLab CI # Automating and running playbooks on my personal machine was too boring, so I decided to utilize GitLab CI to trigger deployments based on commit messages. Currently, the repo responds to deploy \u0026lt;playbook.yml\u0026gt; as well as dry-run \u0026lt;playbook.yml\u0026gt;. Obviously deploy deploys the supplied playbook while the latter initiates a dry run via ansible-playbook \u0026lt;playbook.yml\u0026gt; --check.\nWrapping it all up # I had a great time learning how to use Ansible! It will be really useful to decrease time spent configuring servers, allowing me to focus on other things which aren\u0026rsquo;t automated. After all, changes just need to be pushed by ansible-playbook full_run.yml while setting up a new server became a matter of a few minutes.\n","date":"April 19, 2022","permalink":"/projects/ansible-infra/","section":"My favorite projects","summary":"As our infrastructure is growing, the number of services and tasks is increasing as well.

Since the beginning, I loved the way things work on Linux, the simplicity and customizability - something unheard of in among windows users. A long time of these two years I spent distro hopping, searching for the optimal Linux distribution for my requirements. For those of you who do know the term \u0026ldquo;distro hopping\u0026rdquo; - a very good explanation can be found here! As a result I have tried countless Distributions like with Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch and Gentoo in all kinds of forms. After a while I sticked with Gentoo - the customisability was just too great, turning features on and off at compile time with use flags? Hell yes. But there were two major drawbacks: The compile times on a dual core CPU T440p were just too much (imagine Chromium taking 18 hours to compile) and to get all required software a lot of so called \u0026ldquo;overlays\u0026rdquo; had to be used which made the system feel very messy to me at some point - a solution had to be found.\nEarly days of Garuda Linux üë∂ # During these days I found myself trying out Garuda Linux. It emerged out of the custom Manjaro build called \u0026ldquo;Manjarowish\u0026rdquo; which implemeted a lot of great things such as performance enhancements or OpenSUSE style BTRFS with automated snapshots before each update by default. Garuda takes this to another level running on top of pure Arch which means always the latest and greatest packges! Eventually there was no maintainer for the GNOME edition at the time I was this edition for a short time - being completely new to this kind of business I decided to step in and maintain it (at this time Garuda was still rather unknown - the Telegram group had about 20 members back then). Since then many things changed - a lot of new ideas were implemented, existing tools improved, the team welcomed new members and appearently people like it so far since feedback has been mostly pretty overwhelming!\nExpansion and new ressources üö∏ # Some time passed and the Garuda slowly grew. Everything I did was done using my own hardware for quite some time - that changed when we were suggested checking out Fosshost, a project which provides all kind of hosting services to open source projects. Its goal is to \u0026ldquo;support, promote, and advance the development and movement of free software\u0026rdquo; which is kind of what we are trying to do with Garuda! The time before contributing to Garuda I was learning how to selfhost a lot of open source projects including Searx and Nextcloud but sadly none of my people was actually interested in such things so this seemed like the perfect opportunity to do something useful with the knowledge I aquired.. After some brainstorming we decided to apply for ressources (needed them especially for the forum \u0026amp; building - the cluster which it was running on before was possibly going to be shut down) and got them granted! This means we did not have to take donations to continue providing this distribution until now. There were three VPS for us to use, one to host web services like the website or Searx, one to build iso files (this one also builds packages for Chaotic-AUR now) and one to hold applications which require more storage (looking at you, Nextcloud). Also the people behind Fosshost were really kind and helpful while migrating everything to their services - shoutouts to them!\nSetting everything up üîß # After initial setup of the servers (which I got helped with luckily, the Proxmox VNC window of the VMs was somewhat buggy and didnt input the characters I needed) it was time to actually deploy the applications. This was quite fun and I noticed that it was indeed easy for me after having done countless trial \u0026amp; error sessions at my VPS earlier. The only thing which proved to be impossible to setup along all other applications was Discourse, the forum software. This one comes with a complete installer which turns the system into a forum server and occupies both port 80 and 443 (the ones needed for HTTP and HTTPS) which quite of interfered with NGINX, the proxy server used. Luckily Fosshost gave us one little instance to use for whatever we needed it for - indeed a lucky coincidence because it was perfect to run Discourse on! The migration from its previous location happened without issues. Inspired by Fosshosts Telegram channel (which was bridged into Matrix, the first time I actually heard of it) I did some research on how to bridge our own Telegram channel to a selfhosted Matrix instance as Matrix is an open source and decentralized protocol which allows bridging into many known platforms - among them Telegram! Sounds like heaven for an open source enthusiast who does not want companies to own his data? Well for me it did. Being new to Matrix it took some time to actually figure it all out but in the end it worked quite well. Other things which were setup in the following month were a Telegram moderator bot (Rose - a great open source and free bot) and all applications you can find here. This one also made it into Garudas browser settings as startpage! During this time we also transitioned from Garudas previous domain (.in) to the one we are using today (.org) which was accompanied by me having to learn how to properly forward a domain to another one (you need SSL certificates for both domains, which I did not know back then). But luckily help was not far away and this issue got solved quickly!\nThe future üèÜ # A lot of things happened since that time, I really need to start documenting things again! ü§î There is a crazy detailed podcast dealing with all the things happening to Garuda though, I highly recommend watching it! üî•\n","date":"December 24, 2021","permalink":"/projects/garuda/","section":"My favorite projects","summary":"Since about 2 years I have been using Linux.
