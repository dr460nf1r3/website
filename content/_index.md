Since a few years, I have found a deep passion for open source and Linux. As I kept learning about the importance of FOSS ecosystems, I quickly got interested in selfhosting open source alternatives and contributing to a few projects myself. Thats also how I got involved in the development of [Garuda Linux](https://garudalinux.org).

## Some of the projects I maintain or contribute to:

### [Garuda Linux](https://garudalinux.org)

Garuda Linux is an Arch based Linux distrbution which tries to provide a beautiful and easy to use operating system. I'm mostly maintaining the infrastructure and a few editions.

### [Chaotic-AUR](https://aur.chaotic.cx)

Chaotic-AUR provides binary builds for around 3k packages, most of them being built straight from AUR. As main maintainer, I'm in charge of handling the repository and coordinating work.

### [FireDragon](https://github.com/dr460nf1r3/firedragon-browser)
This is a Librewolf fork which focuses on providing a smoother user experience while keeping the important privacy tweaks. It also integrates quite well with some of our selfhosted services such as [searX](https://searx.garudalinux.org).
