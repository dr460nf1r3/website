Since a few years, I have found a deep passion for open source and Linux. As I kept learning about the importance of FOSS ecosystems, I quickly got interested in selfhosting open source alternatives and contributing to a few projects myself. Thats also how I got involved in the development of [Garuda Linux](https://garudalinux.org).

## Some of the projects I maintain or contribute to:

### [Garuda Linux]({{< ref "projects/garuda" >}})

[Garuda Linux](https://garudalinux.org) is an Arch based Linux distrbution which is both beautiful and easy to use. I'm mostly maintaining the infrastructure and a few editions. You can read more about it [here]({{< ref "projects/garuda" >}}).

### [Chaotic-AUR]({{< ref "projects/chaotic-aur" >}})

[Chaotic-AUR](https://aur.chaotic.cx) is an Arch user repository which provides binary builds for roughly 3k packages, most of them being built hourly straight from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org). As main maintainer, I'm in charge of handling the repository and coordinating work.

### [FireDragon]({{< ref "projects/firedragon" >}})

[FireDragon](https://github.com/dr460nf1r3/firedragon-browser) is a Librewolf fork which focuses on providing a smoother user experience while keeping the important privacy tweaks. It also integrates quite well with some of our selfhosted services such as [searX](https://searx.garudalinux.org).
