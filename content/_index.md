This website serves as a personal blog and will be dealing with Linux and FOSS projects mostly :eagle:

For a few years, I have found a deep passion for open source and Linux. As I kept learning about the importance of FOSS ecosystems, I quickly got interested in self-hosting open-source alternatives and contributing to a few projects myself. That's also how I got involved in the development of [Garuda Linux](https://garudalinux.org).

My most recent project was writing [Ansible roles]({{< ref "projects/ansible-infra" >}}) for the whole Garuda Linux and Chaotic-AUR infrastructure. I'm really happy with how it turned out! :blush:

 <h3> Garuda Linux </h3>
</center>

[Garuda Linux](https://garudalinux.org) is an Arch-based Linux distribution that is both beautiful and easy to use. I'm mostly maintaining the infrastructure and a few editions. You can read more about it [here]({{< ref "projects/garuda" >}}). :eagle:

 <h3> Chaotic-AUR </h3>
</center>

[Chaotic-AUR](https://aur.chaotic.cx) is an Arch user repository that provides binary builds for roughly 3k packages, most of them being built hourly straight from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org). As the lead maintainer, I'm in charge of handling the repository and coordinating work. Have a look at [this page]({{< ref "projects/chaotic-aur" >}}) to find out more! :grin:

 <h3> FireDragon </h3>
</center>

[FireDragon](https://github.com/dr460nf1r3/firedragon-browser) is a Librewolf fork that focuses on providing a smoother user experience while keeping the important privacy tweaks. It also integrates quite well with some of our self-hosted services such as [searX](https://searx.garudalinux.org). Wanna know [more]({{< ref "projects/garuda" >}}) about it? :yum:
