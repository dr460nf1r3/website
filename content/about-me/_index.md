## Who am I?

I'm a Linux and technology enthusiast from Germany who likes maintaining servers and all kinds of Linux-related things to learn more about how these things work inside. Wherever possible I'm trying to spread the word about open source and Linux! I'm also a developer at [Garuda Linux](https://garudalinux.org) as part of a team that is trying to provide a modern and performance-focused operating system for interested people, an activity I enjoy a lot for quite some time! Recently I also became the main maintainer of [Chaotic-AUR](https://aur.chaotic.cx) (which also serves as our repo). Since the beginning of this journey, I could work with an amazing team and learned a lot while doing so! These days I mostly hang around at the Garuda Linux [forum](https://forum.garudalinux.org) & [Telegram](https://t.me/garudalinux) to make sure everything is working as expected - feel free to come by :wave:

## Yes, music is also a big part of my life!

I felt like dropping some goodness here :yum: Carnifex all the way! ðŸ’€

## My hardware

My laptop is a Lenovo Slim 7, a great 14" device with a lot of power thanks to its 8-core AMD Ryzen 7 4800u. Even though this is a low-power CPU, it is relatively quick and provides amazing battery life. You might have guessed it already - its operating system is Garuda dr460nized! :dragon:
